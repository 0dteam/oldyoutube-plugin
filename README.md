# oldyoutube-plugin

Description:

An old Chrome plugin I made when Youtube changed its layout. The plugin lets you browse Youtube with its old style.

How to use:

1) Download this project and put the files in a folder "Old Youtube"
2) Open Chrome browser, then go to Settings menu -> More tools -> Extensions
3) Click "Load unpacked" and choose "Old Youtube" folder
4) The plugin should be enabled by default. If not, enable it.
5) Visit youtube.com and verify if the url ends with "&disable_polymer=1"

Enjoy
